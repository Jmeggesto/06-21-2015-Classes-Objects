// BankAccount needs to have a way of tracking the money the Patron withdraws or deposits, and also of displaying current balance. The patron can add money, subtract money, display their current balance, possibly transfer money from one account to another. Potential additional bonus features: if the patron has multiple accounts, and overdrafts, the difference + a fee is subtracted from their other account.
